`opi/__init__.py`  - saving the results of `get_cpu_arch()` in a variable to reuse them (**L307-320**)
stage[0] is assumed to be for sources, 1: and onwards is  patches/resources, make that a bit more clear.    the implementation isn't very satisfactory cause it fetches  some (unconditional) patches too, but does not apply them, because  that requires a concrete spec.    patches are only applied upon install, at which point even  more may be fetched
Breaks the `seed_offset` into two lines. The first does the hashing (and uses the default encoding). The second maps the hashed value to an integer (making the `base` argument explicit)

Few minor improvements
New pylint allows you to seperately set a maximum number of total aguments and a maximum number of positional arguments. This gave us lots of warnings on the number of functions that had a confusingly high number of arguments.    Rather than just up the limit in pylintrc it seems like good practice to make many of these arguments keyword only. This make code more clear, and more robust as we go forward
Small internal refactoring to avoid usage of index-based access such as `url[1]` or `response[2]`, hopefully making the HTTP proxy implementation even easier to read. :-)

Renaming Metric Name Suffixes using Enum Values for Better Code Readability 
Picking up on an idea I used during my [dogfooding of the "Introduction to `iiif-prezi3`" lightning talk](https://digitaldogsbody.net/iiif/prezi3): due to the structure of the recipes, there are a lot of `id` fields that have a common start, so this PR adds a `base_url` variable and uses it in the various bits of manifest data, meaning that the resulting code looks a bit less cluttered (IMO)

Scalable Code for Language Support  Introduced a dictionary-based approach for language support, making it more scalable. This ensures that new languages can be added in the future with minimal changes, as opposed to multiple conditional statements.    
This commit includes modifications to the code in asort.py to improve code formatting and readability according to the PEP 8 style guidelines. The changes include consistent indentation, proper spacing around operators, proper capitalization of comments, and using parentheses for print statements for compatibility with Python 3.    Please note that these changes are purely stylistic and do not affect the functionality of the script. The goal is to enhance code maintainability and readability.

When I worked on PR #750 based on the implemention of the `grdview` function, I found that the `grdview` codes are a little difficult to understand. The main reason is that `contextlib.ExitStack()` is new to me. Another reason is that these two codes `fname = stack.enter_context(file_context)` and `arg_str = " ".join([fname, build_arg_string(kwargs)])` are separated by the long `if` block.     
`all_input_tokens` and `all_spaces` should not be member variables. First time call `custom_tokenizer()` is fine, but the second time call returns an unexpected result.
code readability improvements [e.g., replacing long attributes such as `self.prior.kernel(...)` with `kernel = self.prior.kernel` then `kernel(...)`].
`doc = custom_tokenizer()` is not quite easy to understand because `TokenPreservingTokenizer.__call__` has a different API from spaCy's `Tokenizer.__call__`, which takes a string as an input.  
Honestly I had no idea what `torch.ones([]) * self.config.logit_scale_init_value` would return - it's not documented either.    ~Proposing to change it to a very clear `torch.tensor(1.0)` which leaves no doubt to what it does.~    Proposing to change it to a very clear `torch.tensor(self.config.logit_scale_init_value)` which leaves no doubt to what it does.

The only point to using it is with `break`. (but it doesn't lead to a bug, just a harder to understand the code) So I'm proposing to remove the `else` control and just run the code in its branch normally since it *always* gets executed as there is no `break` statement.    And the objective of this code is to always be run if I understand it correctly. So let's make it loud and clear.   
simplify *if* statement for setting the `weight` of a result (**L348**)  
Improved code readability by removing unnecessary else statement
Module thumbor.utils  thumbor/utils.py:92:4: R1705: Unnecessary "else" after "return", remove the "else" and de-indent the code inside it (no-else-return)

avoid use of logical OR | Whilst using a logical OR | for this felt novel at the time, it has now tripped up two codereviewers on separate occasions who appropriately reach the conclusion that it's likely a mistake. It's not a functionality mistake, but it is a readability mistake. Lets not waste anyone else's time
Simplified boundary check logic in within_bounds function    - Removed redundant 'elif' condition that duplicated the 'if' logic.   - Improved code readability by using a single 'else' block to handle out-of-bounds cases.  - The refactored logic maintains the same functionality while reducing unnecessary complexity

Improve code readability by making better use of pathlib.
Optimized return_details function:      Replaced unnecessary conversion to list with a set data structure. `target_urls` are not being accessed by index after removing duplicates. Code in`github_scrapers`:        Old code: `target_urls = list(set(target_urls))`        New Code: `target_urls = set(target_urls)`       Reduces memory usage by avoiding redundant data storage.      
The Path() constructor already handles both str and Path types effectively.
Shorten lines with dict.get() default arguments
Update simple_paths.py to improve readability of the BFS. There is at least one place in NetworkX that uses collections.OrderedDict as a substitute for an insertion-ordered set. This is an undesirable workaround: it makes code harder than necessary to read.
on `standard_paths function`:      * I used `os.path.isdir` instead of `try: ... except OSError: pass`  for checking if `lib-dynload` exists

Rm unnecessary binding of local variable.
Fix incorrect capitalization of `Dict` type hint that does not specify the key and value types. 
Add `schema()` and `field()` sugar to improve readability of tests
`__getitem__` is never called with more than a single arg, and we can  just use normal indexing on _mask both for getting and for setting.   
Various readability/typos/cleanup fixes - no functionality change.    I tried to make `_save_checkpoint` a bit more readable, but the auto-formatter still makes things harder to read than it can be.
Use enumerate for readability
Use enumerate more in PdfWriter
I also made a few other minor tweaks (while -> for)
the `node_classification` package was implemented in such a way that there were a lot of simple (one-or-few-liner) expressions that were wrapped up in "helper" functions. In principle this was done because the functionality was reused in both the `harmonic_function` and `local_and_global_consistency` functions, but IMO the code is improved by reducing the indirection introduced by all the utility functions.
Edit a line to ``self(x)`` for readability
In the "top-level" ThreadPoolExecutor used for threading plugin execution, increase readability and reliability by wrapping it in a with context manager, so that the pool's cleanup is run in all situations explicitly
Save `centroids` and `embeddings` in a dictionary with their "feature_name" as the key. This cleans up some code in `_get_cost_matrix` as well.  
simplified an area with duplicated code.
 Improved the performance test readability, added functions to remove some dup codes.     
removed duplicated code  - use create_jwt function where applicable  this addresses #74
As many tokenzer variations are added, its complexity is increasing and it is hard to understand what each code block means. We better clean up duplicated code and enhance code readability.  
This PR improves readability for backend tests.Since CNTK added, it becomes hard to add something into backend tests due to many hardcoded and cntk-specific patchwork. I think it is better to clean up the current tests first in order to write new tests for increasing test coverages. Especially, this PR focuses on integration of `cntk_check_*_tensor_operation` into `check_*_tensor_operation`.
Refactor splitter code to enhance readability (DRY principle).   
I introduced a new `_create_label_group` method to the `PyBadger` class to help improve code readability and reduce code duplication.    
I knew how these blocks worked off-hand and it caused some confusion, so I'm trying to rewrite the logic in a (hopefully) clearer fashion.  
The first conv in the previous implementation is unnecessary since the input channels can be determined when passing parameters.    ## Modification    The first conv is combined into the loops. Thus, the readability and structure are improved..  
Remove unnecessary code duplication in `validator.py`  
Shorten long lines and reduce code repetition
Minor PR for refactoring a test. I rewrote the test because I was going to add zarr as another test case, then decided OME-Zarr warrants its own operator and won't go here.    I think the refactoring is still helpful in its own right. It makes the difference between the test cases clearer, and makes sure the h5 and n5 tests don't depend on each other (plus it's a bit shorter :smile: ).    The actual test cases covered and how they're implemented could be improved I think. I'm also not sure about the value of the third test using `.Output.meta.ram_usage_per_requested_pixel = 1000000.0` to force writing in tiny blocks. This test takes 0.5s to run, which is a long time for a test case that seems unnecessary to cover to me. But I intentionally purely refactored here to make review easier.    Note: Squash-merge when re-integrating to main
deduplicate URL building for GPG key in `install_binary()` (**L394**) 
It was suggested to use a paramterized test to avoid code duplication in tests.

This CL also fixes a code duplication issue in thumbor/utils.py
remove "skip monitoring lock for the files in the same run.", the useless statement.
removed 3 functions in _telemetry  
`interview.file_name` was never used. Made clearer which label is being used where by using `interview_label` directly, and basing new `package_title` off of the `interview_label` to reduce chance of errors in the 2-3 places we were previously using the same regex to get the package title.  
Remove backwards compatibility patches 
Also deletes two unused methods.   
Functions that are not used anywhere should be removed, even if they were used previously

Changed named lambdas into function declarations (pep8 E731)
Replace long lambda with local function
Extract callback for readability   I know that a lot of similar classes use the `on_results=lambda x: serialize(x, ...)` pattern (I'm fine with lambdas generally) but this is one of the only multiline ones with a big compound expression.

All introduced methods are quite short, so primarily for readability
Extract out `_grad_transform_jac_via_callaback` and `_device_method_jac_via_callback` to being global functions with explicit argument lists, instead of depending on closure. This reduces nesting, allows the functions to be experimented on and tested independently, and makes the dependencies explicit. The previous syntax also called local variables like `params` the same thing as a parameter from outer scope
on_event: Refactored event processing by splitting it into two distinct functions: _handle_action and _handle_observation 
The method `ExecutionEngine.resolve_metrics()` is being refactored into two principal parts: gathering aggregated and non-aggregated metric computation specifications, and resolving the corresponding metrics.  The non-aggregated metrics are resolved by calling their function.  The aggregated metrics are bundled (for efficiency).  Code readability is improved
Try to improve readability of binary ops by reorganize it as a `BinaryOp` class.  This pull request focuses on improving the readability and maintainability of the binary operation utility code within the Snowflake query compiler. The changes primarily involve refactoring the binary operation functions into a new `BinaryOp` class and updating the relevant method calls throughout the codebase
Create formal `ValidationDependencies` `dataclass` object
Moved to dataclass for easier handling and better readability
Previously, all components of the vector db CDK would pass data around as a `Chunk`, which is:  * the text  * the metadata  * the record that created the chunk  * the embedding    As not all of these are available at all times, checks in a bunch of places were necessary.    This PR refactors this by passing "Documents" to the embedder, which is just the text and the record, because that's what's required for running the embedding.
For exports and variables we want a type and usage to accompany the proof types. This change is significant because it changes the proofs from NameTuples to frozen dataclasses. This gives the same immutability but the flexibility to have non essential information stored for serializing.
Pulls `st.echo` out of `__init__.py` and into `echo.py`
The `GMT_DATASET` data structure was originally added in #2729, with nested classes defined like `GMT_DATASET`->`GMT_DATATABLE`->`GMT_DATASEGMENT`.    the nested classes are difficult to read and maintain.    This PR moves the `GMT_DATATABLE`/`GMT_DATASEGMENT` classes outside of the `GMT_DATASET` class
This set of commits adds a few new mixin classes to the pyDeltaRCM project that are inherited by the more general Tools class.     The divisions are as follows:   - `water_tools` contains all the methods required for conducting water routing steps.  - `sed_tools` contains all methods for morphodynamics steps only.   - `shared_tools` contains methods shared across `water_tools` and `sed_tools`  - `init_tools` contains methods for setting up the model domain.  - `Tools` inherits all these classes, and then mixes them into the primary methods that include the main model processes for each time step.    This pull request closes #11

Use `:ivar:` to document class fields.        Using class fields documentation renders the code less readable. In my last commit, I introduced such documentation type.        This commit is to use the `:ivar:` tag to document a class field.    The last SPDX package objects added (`PackageComment` and `PackaheHomePage`) had an invalid JSON representation.    The tag for `PackageComment` is `"comment"`, not `"comments"`.  The tag for `PackageHomePage` is `"homepage"`, not `"homePage"`.
