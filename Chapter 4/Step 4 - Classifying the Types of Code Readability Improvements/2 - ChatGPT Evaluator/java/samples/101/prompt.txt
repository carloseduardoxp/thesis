Based on this pull request with the developer description: Reorder HoodieTimeline#compareTimestamp arguments for better readability reads nicely as (instantTime1, GREATER_OR_EQUAL, instantTime2) etc, the code was changed by the developer from if (sourceLatestCommit != null
         && HoodieTimeline.compareTimestamps(targetLatestCommit, sourceLatestCommit, HoodieTimeline.GREATER)) {
       return getString(target, targetTimeline, source, sourceCount, targetCount, sourceLatestCommit); } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if (sourceLatestCommit != null
         && HoodieTimeline.compareTimestamps(targetLatestCommit, HoodieTimeline.GREATER_THAN, sourceLatestCommit)) {
       return getString(target, targetTimeline, source, sourceCount, targetCount, sourceLatestCommit); }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
