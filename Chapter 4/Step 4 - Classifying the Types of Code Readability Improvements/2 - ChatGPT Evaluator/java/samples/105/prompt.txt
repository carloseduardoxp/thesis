Based on this pull request with the developer description: Improving code readability - Extracting actual and expected variables, so the types are visible in the tests., the code was changed by the developer from Assert.assertEquals(
                 SMALL_INTERVAL.toList(),
                 this.smallData.stream().collect(Collectors2.toImmutableList())); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to MutableList<Integer> expected = SMALL_INTERVAL.toList();
         ImmutableList<Integer> actual = this.smallData.stream().collect(Collectors2.toImmutableList());
         Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
