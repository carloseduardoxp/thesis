Based on this pull request with the developer description: Remove unnecessary instance variable in QueryStringQueryParser, the code was changed by the developer from private MappedFieldType currentFieldType;  private Query getRangeQuerySingle(String field, String part1, String part2,
                                       boolean startInclusive, boolean endInclusive, QueryShardContext context) {
         currentFieldType = context.fieldMapper(field); } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to private Query getRangeQuerySingle(String field, String part1, String part2,
                                       boolean startInclusive, boolean endInclusive, QueryShardContext context) {
      MappedFieldType currentFieldType = context.fieldMapper(field); }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
