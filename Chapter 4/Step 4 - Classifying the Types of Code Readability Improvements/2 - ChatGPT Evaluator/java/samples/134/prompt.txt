Based on this pull request with the developer description: minor reorganization to reduce static variables and clarify flow of control for Omex exporting., the code was changed by the developer from public class VcmlOmexConverter { private static boolean bForceVCML = false;                // set by the -vcml CL argument, means we export to omex as vcml (if missing, default we try sbml first)         private static boolean bForceSBML = false;                // set by the -sbml CL argument, means we export to omex strictly as sbml (mutually exclusive with -vcml)         private static boolean bHasDataOnly = false;        // we only export those simulations that have at least some results; set by -hasDataOnly CL argument         private static boolean bMakeLogsOnly = false;        // we do not build omex files, we just write the logs         private static boolean bNonSpatialOnly = false;        // we only export non-spatial } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to public static void convertFiles(CLIDatabaseService cliDatabaseService, CLIHandler cliHandler) throws IOException, SQLException, DataAccessException {  boolean bForceSBML = cliHandler.shouldForceSbml();                 boolean bForceVCML = cliHandler.shouldForceVcml();                 boolean bHasDataOnly = cliHandler.isHasDataOnly();                 boolean bMakeLogsOnly = cliHandler.isMakeLogsOnly();                 boolean bNonSpatialOnly = cliHandler.isNonSpacialOnly(); }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
