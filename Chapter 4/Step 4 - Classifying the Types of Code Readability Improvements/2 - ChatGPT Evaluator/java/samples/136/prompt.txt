Based on this pull request with the developer description: replace the boolean that was added as a parameter with a separate method with a different name which internally references a private method that uses the boolean flag., the code was changed by the developer from return expressionResolver.resolveExpression(expression, false); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return expressionResolver.resolveExpressionSilently(expression);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
