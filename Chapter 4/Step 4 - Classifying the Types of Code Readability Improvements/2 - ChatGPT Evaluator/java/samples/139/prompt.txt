Based on this pull request with the developer description: These are generic-ed off in the other instanceof checks, these ones don't need to be different., the code was changed by the developer from else if (context instanceof List) { (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to } else if (context instanceof List<?>) {, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
