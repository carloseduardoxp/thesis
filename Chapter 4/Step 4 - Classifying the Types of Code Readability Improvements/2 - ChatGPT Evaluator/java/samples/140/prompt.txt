Based on this pull request with the developer description: some deprecations fixed around StandardCharsets.UTF_8, the code was changed by the developer from FileUtils.writeStringToFile(f, FileUtils.readFileToString(f).replaceAll("Hello World", "Good Evening")); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to FileUtils.writeStringToFile(f, FileUtils.readFileToString(f, StandardCharsets.UTF_8).replaceAll("Hello World", "Good Evening"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
