Based on this pull request with the developer description: improve readability by removing boilerplate code., the code was changed by the developer from List<Plugin> expectedPlugins = new ArrayList<>();
         expectedPlugins.add(new Plugin("workflow-scm-step", "2.4", null, null));
         expectedPlugins.add(new Plugin("workflow-step-api", "2.20", null, null));
 
         List<String> expectedPluginInfo = convertPluginsToStrings(expectedPlugins); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to List<String> expectedPluginInfo = convertPluginsToStrings(
                 new Plugin("workflow-scm-step", "2.4", null, null),
                 new Plugin("workflow-step-api", "2.20", null, null));, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
