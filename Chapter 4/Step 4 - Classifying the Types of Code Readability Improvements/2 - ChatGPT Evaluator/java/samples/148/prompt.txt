Based on this pull request with the developer description: Improve readability of the test by simplifying its parameters generator. The parameters generator uses CompressionStrategy.noNoneValues() instead of CompressionStrategyTest.compressionStrategies() which wrapped each CompressionStrategy in a single element array., the code was changed by the developer from final Iterable<CompressionStrategy> compressionStrategies = Iterables.transform(         CompressionStrategyTest.compressionStrategies(),         (Object[] input) -> (CompressionStrategy) input[0]     ); Sets.newHashSet(compressionStrategies), (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to Sets.newHashSet(CompressionStrategy.noNoneValues()),, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
