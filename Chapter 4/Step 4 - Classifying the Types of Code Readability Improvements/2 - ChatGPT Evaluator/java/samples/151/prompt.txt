Based on this pull request with the developer description: using the min, max might make the code a little easier to read., the code was changed by the developer from if (binNumber > maxBinNumber) {                 return maxBinNumber;             }             return binNumber; (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return Math.min(binNumber, maxBinNumber);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
