Based on this pull request with the developer description: Use functional programming to improve code readability I refactored methods to use Java 8's streams API to improve readability., the code was changed by the developer from StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
         for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
             sb.append(character);
         }
         return sb.toString(); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return String.join("", Collections.nCopies(length, String.valueOf(character)));, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
