Based on this pull request with the developer description: Use TimeUnit instead of plain number to improve readability, the code was changed by the developer from private int connectionTimeoutInMS = 20 * 1000; (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to private int connectionTimeoutInMS = (int) TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(20);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
