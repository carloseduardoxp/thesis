Based on this pull request with the developer description: chore: Use getOrDefault instead of Optional.ofNullable.orElse to aid in readability, the code was changed by the developer from final String groupId = Optional.ofNullable(parameters.get(GROUP_ID)).orElse(""); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to final String groupId = parameters.getOrDefault(GROUP_ID, "");, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
