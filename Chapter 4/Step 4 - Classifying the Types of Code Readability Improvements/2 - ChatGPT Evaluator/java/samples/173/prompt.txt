Based on this pull request with the developer description: use pattern matching for instanceof where applicable, the code was changed by the developer from if (node instanceof LeafNode) {
                 leafSize = ((LeafNode) node).leafValue.length; (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if (node instanceof LeafNode leafNode) {
                 leafSize = leafNode.leafValue.length;, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
