Based on this pull request with the developer description: This moves all the wrapper type construction in the code and tests to use the static constructor., the code was changed by the developer from return new GraphQLList(buildDirectiveInputType(getArrayValueWrappedType(arrayValue))); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return list(buildDirectiveInputType(getArrayValueWrappedType(arrayValue)));, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
