Based on this pull request with the developer description: Remove unnecessary object manipulation across method calls, the code was changed by the developer from Map<CommitSession,TabletMutations> sendables = new HashMap<>(); TabletMutations tMutations = new TabletMutations(commitSession.getLogId(), commitSession.getWALogSeq(), mutations, durability); sendables.put(commitSession, tMutations); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to Map<CommitSession,List<Mutation>> sendables = new HashMap<>(); sendables.put(commitSession, mutations);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
