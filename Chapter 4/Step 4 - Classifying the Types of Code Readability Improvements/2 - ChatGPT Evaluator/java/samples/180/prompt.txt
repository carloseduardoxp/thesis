Based on this pull request with the developer description: try out Java8 lambdas to get a feel for them (terminal code), the code was changed by the developer from activateTerminal(new Display.DisplaySelectedCallback()
       {
          @Override
          public void displaySelected()
          {
             ensureTerminal(text);
             Scheduler.get().scheduleDeferred(new ScheduledCommand()
             {
                @Override
                public void execute()
                {
                   suppressAutoFocus_ = false;
                }
             });
          } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to activateTerminal(() -> {
          ensureTerminal(text);
          Scheduler.get().scheduleDeferred(() -> { suppressAutoFocus_ = false; });, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
