Based on this pull request with the developer description: Introduce Lambdas  to improve on readability and reduce boilerplate code., the code was changed by the developer from IllegalArgumentException.class, new Runnable() {
             @Override
             public void run() {
               new AvroSchemaConverter().convert(message(type));
             }
           }); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new AvroSchemaConverter().convert(message(type)));, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
