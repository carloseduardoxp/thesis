Based on this pull request with the developer description: The latch's name made it seem like it was a mock, the code was changed by the developer from CountDownLatch mockConnectionLatch = new CountDownLatch(1); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to CountDownLatch countDownLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
