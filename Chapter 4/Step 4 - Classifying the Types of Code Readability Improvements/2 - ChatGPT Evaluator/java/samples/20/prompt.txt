Based on this pull request with the developer description: ForClauseLocalToRowClosure is renamed to ForClausedLocalTupleToRowClosure (clarity for additions to coming with RumbleML), the code was changed by the developer from public class ForClauseLocalToRowClosure implements Function<Item, Row> { (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to public class ForClauseLocalTupleToRowClosure implements Function<Item, Row> {, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
