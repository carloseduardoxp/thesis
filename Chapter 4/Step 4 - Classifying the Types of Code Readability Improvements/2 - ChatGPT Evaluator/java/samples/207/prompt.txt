Based on this pull request with the developer description: This commit regroups the conditions, the code was changed by the developer from if (executor.isShutdown() == false && r instanceof AbstractRunnable abstractRunnable) {             if (abstractRunnable.isForceExecution()) {                 if (executor.getQueue() instanceof SizeBlockingQueue<Runnable> sizeBlockingQueue) {                     try {                         sizeBlockingQueue.forcePut(r);                     } catch (InterruptedException e) {                         Thread.currentThread().interrupt();                         throw new IllegalStateException("forced execution, but got interrupted", e);                     }                     if ((executor.isShutdown() && sizeBlockingQueue.remove(r)) == false) {                         return;                     } // else fall through and reject the task since the executor is shut down                 } else {                     throw new IllegalStateException("expected but did not find SizeBlockingQueue: " + executor); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if (executor.isShutdown() == false && isForceExecution(r)) {             if (executor.getQueue() instanceof SizeBlockingQueue<Runnable> sizeBlockingQueue) {                 try {                     sizeBlockingQueue.forcePut(r);                 } catch (InterruptedException e) {                     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();                     throw new IllegalStateException("forced execution, but got interrupted", e);                 }                 if ((executor.isShutdown() && sizeBlockingQueue.remove(r)) == false) {                     return;                 } // else fall through and reject the task since the executor is shut down             } else {                 throw new IllegalStateException("expected but did not find SizeBlockingQueue: " + executor);             }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
