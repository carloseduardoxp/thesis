Based on this pull request with the developer description: Changed switch to if-else to increase readability for Elytro, the code was changed by the developer from switch (reader.getLocalName()) {
                     case "rule": {
                         rulesList.add(ruleParseFunction.apply(reader, configurations));
                         break;
                     }
                     default: throw reader.unexpectedElement(); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if (reader.getLocalName().equals("rule")) {
                     rulesList.add(ruleParseFunction.apply(reader, configurations));
                 } else {
                     throw reader.unexpectedElement();, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
