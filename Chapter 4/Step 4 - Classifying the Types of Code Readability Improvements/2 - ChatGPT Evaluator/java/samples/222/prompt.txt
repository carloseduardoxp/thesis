Based on this pull request with the developer description: Improve condition for more readability some codebase conditions are too complex and we can make it simple for readability purpose., the code was changed by the developer from if (value != null) {       accessor = new DirectFieldAccessor(value); } else if (i == tokens.length - 1) {       return null; } else {       throw new IllegalArgumentException("intermediate property '" + tokens[i] + "' is null"); } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if (value != null) {      accessor = new DirectFieldAccessor(value);      continue;  } if (i == tokens.length - 1) {         return null; } throw new IllegalArgumentException("intermediate property '" + tokens[i] + "' is null");, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
