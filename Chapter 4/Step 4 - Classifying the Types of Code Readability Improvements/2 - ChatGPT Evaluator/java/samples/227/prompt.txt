Based on this pull request with the developer description: Implement the try-with-resources construct available in Java 7+ where applicable., the code was changed by the developer from Scanner scanner = null;
           try {
             scanner = new Scanner(new File(value), UTF_8); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(value), UTF_8)) {, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer.
