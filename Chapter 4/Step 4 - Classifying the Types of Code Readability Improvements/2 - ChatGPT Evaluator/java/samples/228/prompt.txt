Based on this pull request with the developer description: Use try-with-resource in 'Dockerfile#parse()', the code was changed by the developer from try {
             // encoding probably irrelevant since image/tag names must be ASCII
             BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, "ISO-8859-1")); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to try (InputStream is = dockerfilePath.read();
              BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, "ISO-8859-1"))) {, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
