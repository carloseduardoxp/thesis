Based on this pull request with the developer description: Remove redundant local variables from services' implementation, the code was changed by the developer from Page<SubscriptionStatsEntity> subscriptionStatsEntities = subscriptionsStatsMapper.findByTopicStatsId(topicStatsId, timestamp);
         return subscriptionStatsEntities; (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return subscriptionsStatsMapper.findByTopicStatsId(topicStatsId, timestamp);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
