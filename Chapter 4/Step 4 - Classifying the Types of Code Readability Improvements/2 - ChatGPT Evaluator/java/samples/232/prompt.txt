Based on this pull request with the developer description: use objectmapper in both directions, enhance readability, the code was changed by the developer from ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
         return mapper.convertValue(this, AssaultPropertiesUpdate.class); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return new ObjectMapper().convertValue(this, AssaultPropertiesUpdate.class);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
