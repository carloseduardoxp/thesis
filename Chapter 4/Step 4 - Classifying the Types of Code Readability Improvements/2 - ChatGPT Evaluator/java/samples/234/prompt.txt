Based on this pull request with the developer description: Simplify setHoveredFriend to allow clearer variable names, the code was changed by the developer from target = Text.removeTags(target); String targetNote = getFriendNote(target); if (targetNote != null) {        hoveredFriend = new HoveredFriend(target, targetNote); } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to final String note = getFriendNote(displayName); if (note != null) {    hoveredFriend = new HoveredFriend(displayName, note); }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
