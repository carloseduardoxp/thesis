Based on this pull request with the developer description: collapse simple bool return., the code was changed by the developer from if (type.equals("junit") || type.equals("java") || type.equals("query")
         || type.equals("dunit")) {
       return true;
     } else {
       return false;
     } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return type.equals("junit") || type.equals("java") || type.equals("query")
         || type.equals("dunit");, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
