Based on this pull request with the developer description: Replace string concatination inside an append call with a chained append calls to make the code a tad easier to read, the code was changed by the developer from sb.append("[Mockito] Unused stubbings of: " + mock).append("\n"); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to sb.append("[Mockito] Unused stubbings of: ").append(mock).append("\n");, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
