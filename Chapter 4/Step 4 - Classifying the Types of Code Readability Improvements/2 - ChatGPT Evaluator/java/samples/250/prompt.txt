Based on this pull request with the developer description: I have replaced string concatenation with Log4j ParameterizedMessage in 40 files., the code was changed by the developer from String errorMessage = "Workflow validation failed for template " + templateWithUser.name(); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to String errorMessage = ParameterizedMessageFactory.INSTANCE.newMessage(
                     "Workflow validation failed for template {}",
                     templateWithUser.name()
                 ).getFormattedMessage();, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
