Based on this pull request with the developer description: Remove Assert. in the tests to improve readability. Simplified assert statements in the tests. Switch to usage of static imports in tests., the code was changed by the developer from Assert.assertTrue(ServiceConfiguration.class.isInstance(returnValue)); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to import static org.testng.Assert.assertTrue; assertTrue(returnValue instanceof ServiceConfiguration);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
