Based on this pull request with the developer description: fix: cleanup dead code patterns. Unreachable throw statements clutter code and may cause static analysis warnings, the code was changed by the developer from throw new Error("Missing return statement in function"); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return left;, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
