Based on this pull request with the developer description: The ReadEntity, and WriteEntity parameters in TaskCompiler#optimizeOperatorPlan are passed in this method and various subsequent ones but they are never actually used so they can be removed., the code was changed by the developer from protected void optimizeOperatorPlan(ParseContext pCtx, Set<ReadEntity> inputs,
       Set<WriteEntity> outputs) throws SemanticException { (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to protected void optimizeOperatorPlan(ParseContext pCtx) throws SemanticException {, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
