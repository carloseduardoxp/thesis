Based on this pull request with the developer description: Removing unused and incorrectly documented constructor from SnapshotDeletionsInProgress, the code was changed by the developer from /**
      * Returns a new instance of {@link SnapshotDeletionsInProgress} with the given
      * {@link Entry} added.
      */
     public static SnapshotDeletionsInProgress newInstance(Entry entry) {
         return new SnapshotDeletionsInProgress(Collections.singletonList(entry));
     } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
