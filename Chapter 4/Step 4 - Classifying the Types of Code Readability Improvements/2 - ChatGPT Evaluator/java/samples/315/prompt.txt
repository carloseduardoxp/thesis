Based on this pull request with the developer description: Remove redundant null checks., the code was changed by the developer from private Intent parseDeepLinkId(String deepLinkId) {         if (deepLinkId == null) {             return null;         } String[] parts = deepLinkId.split("/"); } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to private Intent parseDeepLinkId(@NonNull String deepLinkId) { String[] parts = deepLinkId.split("/"); }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
