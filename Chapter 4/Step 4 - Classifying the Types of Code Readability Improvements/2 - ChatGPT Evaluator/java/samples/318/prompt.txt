Based on this pull request with the developer description: if (true) return patterns are redundant and misleading, the code was changed by the developer from final public PropertyExpression variable() throws ParseException {
         Token t;
         PropertyExpression left = null;
         t = jj_consume_token(ID);
         left = new PropertyExpression(t.image);
         {
             if (true) return left;
         }
         throw new Error("Missing return statement in function"); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to final public PropertyExpression variable() throws ParseException {
         Token t;
         PropertyExpression left = null;
         t = jj_consume_token(ID);
         left = new PropertyExpression(t.image);
         return left;, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
