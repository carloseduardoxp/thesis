Based on this pull request with the developer description: Improve code readability,remove the continue keyword, the code was changed by the developer from if (totalSizeOfFilesPresent <= totalSizeToRead) {         endOffset++;         continue;       } else { return Pair.of(startOffset, endOffset);
       } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if (totalSizeOfFilesPresent <= totalSizeToRead) {         endOffset++;       } else { return Pair.of(startOffset, endOffset);
       }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
