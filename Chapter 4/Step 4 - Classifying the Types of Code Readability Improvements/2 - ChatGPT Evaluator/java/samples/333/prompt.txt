Based on this pull request with the developer description: Separating responsibilities to improve readability and maintainability, the code was changed by the developer from EntityMetadata entityMetadata = converter.apply(entity);
                 if (entityMetadata.hasEntityName()) {
                     mappings.put(entityMetadata.name(), entityMetadata);
                 }
                 classes.put(entity, entityMetadata); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to private void processEmbeddables(ClassScanner scanner) {
         for (Class<?> embeddable : scanner.embeddables()) {
             EntityMetadata entityMetadata = convertToEntityMetadata(embeddable);
             classes.put(embeddable, entityMetadata);
         }
     }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
