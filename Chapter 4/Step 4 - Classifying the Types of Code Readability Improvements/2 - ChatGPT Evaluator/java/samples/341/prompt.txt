Based on this pull request with the developer description: Removed redundancy of schema generation for each tuple., the code was changed by the developer from Set<String> oldColumnNames = this.inputTuple.getLocalKeys();             List<String> newColumnNames = new ArrayList<>(oldColumnNames);              newColumnNames.add(this.variableName);             List<StructField> fields = new ArrayList<>();             for (String columnName : newColumnNames) {                 StructField field = DataTypes.createStructField(columnName, DataTypes.BinaryType, true);                 fields.add(field); StructType schema = DataTypes.createStructType(fields); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to schema = generateSchema();, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
