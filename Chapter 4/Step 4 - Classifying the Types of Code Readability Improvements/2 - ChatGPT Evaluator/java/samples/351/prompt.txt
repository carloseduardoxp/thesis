Based on this pull request with the developer description: extract `queryTypeSelectionCriteria` method, the code was changed by the developer from assertMatch(selectors, new SelectionCriteria(true, "test_user", Optional.empty(), ImmutableSet.of(), EMPTY_RESOURCE_ESTIMATES, Optional.of("select")), "global.select"); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to private static SelectionCriteria queryTypeSelectionCriteria(String queryType)
     { return new SelectionCriteria(true, "test_user", Optional.empty(), ImmutableSet.of(), EMPTY_RESOURCE_ESTIMATES, Optional.of(queryType));
     }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
