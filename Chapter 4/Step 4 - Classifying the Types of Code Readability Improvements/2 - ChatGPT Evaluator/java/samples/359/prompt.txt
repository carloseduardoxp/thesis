Based on this pull request with the developer description: This utility class effectively addresses the issue of null or inappropriate page or limit values by providing a default value. It enhances the readability of the code by implementing more easily understandable methods, the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to public class PaginationControllerUtils {
 
   public static int getAbsoluteMinNumber(@Nullable Integer number,
       @Nullable Integer defaultNumber) {
 
     if (number == null && defaultNumber == null) {
       return 1;
     }
 
     if (defaultNumber == null) {
       defaultNumber = number;
     }
 
     if (number == null) {
       return Math.abs(defaultNumber);
     }
 
     return Math.abs(Math.min(number, defaultNumber));
   }
 
 }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
