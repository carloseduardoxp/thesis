Based on this pull request with the developer description: move all index interfaces and definitions out of CorfuTable and into a separate class., the code was changed by the developer from for (Index<K, V, ? extends Comparable> index : indexSpec) { (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to for (Index.Spec<K, V, ? extends Comparable> index : indexSpec)   public class Index {      /**      * Denotes a function that supplies the unique name of an index registered to      * {@link CorfuTable}.      */     @FunctionalInterface     public interface Name extends Supplier<String> {     }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
