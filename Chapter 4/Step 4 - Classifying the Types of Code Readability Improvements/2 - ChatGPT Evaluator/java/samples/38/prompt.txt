Based on this pull request with the developer description: Renamed DependendencySubstitutions.hasRules to .rulesMayAddProjectDependency,since this better reflects the method intent, the code was changed by the developer from public boolean hasRules() { (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to public boolean rulesMayAddProjectDependency() {, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
