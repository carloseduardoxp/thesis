Based on this pull request with the developer description: add doc, the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to /**
      * Check if the given async proxy method's return type is Mono&lt;ResponseBase&lt;H, T&gt&gt;
      *
      * @param proxyMethod the proxy method to check.
      * @return true if the proxy method returns ResponseBase wrapped in a Mono, false otherwise.
      */, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
