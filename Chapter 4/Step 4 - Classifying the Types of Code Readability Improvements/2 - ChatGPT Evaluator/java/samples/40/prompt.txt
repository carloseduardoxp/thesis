Based on this pull request with the developer description: Renamed variable names to enhance readability., the code was changed by the developer from List<Text> endRows = _listSplits(tableName); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to final List<Text> existingSplits = _listSplits(tableName);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
