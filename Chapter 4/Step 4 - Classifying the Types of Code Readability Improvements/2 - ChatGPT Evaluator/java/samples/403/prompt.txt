Based on this pull request with the developer description: document UnitOfWork.loadRestoredOutput() to loadAlreadyProducedOutput(), the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to /**
      * Loads output not produced during the current execution.
      * This can be output produced during a previous execution when the work is up-to-date,
      * or loaded from cache.
      */, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
