         String nonce) { (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to protected void sendResponse(
         ResourceType type, List<Any> resources, String versionInfo, String nonce) {, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer.
