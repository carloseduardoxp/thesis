Based on this pull request with the developer description: Noticed this paragraphing problem and I found it confusing., the code was changed by the developer from Keyboard keyboard = new Keyboard(remoteRobot);
         // find the location in the file to begin the stanza insertion
         // since we know this is a new empty file, go to position 1,1
         goToLineAndColumn(remoteRobot, keyboard, 1, 1); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to Keyboard keyboard = new Keyboard(remoteRobot);
                 // find the location in the file to begin the stanza insertion
                 // since we know this is a new empty file, go to position 1,1
                 goToLineAndColumn(remoteRobot, keyboard, 1, 1);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
