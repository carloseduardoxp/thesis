Based on this pull request with the developer description: olution was a bit improved due to place the only character patter per line to increase readability and make maintenance easier., the code was changed by the developer from "(00[0-1][0-9A-Fa-f]|00[8-9][0-9A-Fa-f]|00[aA][dD]|034[fF]|070[fF]"
             + "|180[eE]|200[b-fB-F]|202[a-eA-E]|206[0-4a-fA-F]"
             + "|[fF]{3}[9a-bA-B]|[fF][eE][fF]{2})"); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to "(00[0-1][0-9A-Fa-f]"             + "|00[8-9][0-9A-Fa-f]"             + "|00[aA][dD]"             + "|034[fF]"             + "|070[fF]"             + "|180[eE]"             + "|200[b-fB-F]"             + "|202[a-eA-E]"             + "|206[0-4a-fA-F]"             + "|[fF]{3}[9a-bA-B]"             + "|[fF][eE][fF]{2})");, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
