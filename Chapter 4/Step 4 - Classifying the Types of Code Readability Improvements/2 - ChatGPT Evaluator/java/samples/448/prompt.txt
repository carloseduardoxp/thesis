Based on this pull request with the developer description: Use text block to improve readability of test, the code was changed by the developer from text("class Inner {\n" + "  text: String = \"Bar\"\n" + "}\n" + "inner: Inner")); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to text(
                   """
                   class Inner {
                     text: String = "Bar"
                   }
                   inner: Inner
                   """));, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
