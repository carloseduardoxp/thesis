Based on this pull request with the developer description: Removed wildcard imports from Functions.java, the code was changed by the developer from import static org.rumbledb.runtime.functions.base.Functions.FunctionNames.*; (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to import static org.rumbledb.runtime.functions.base.Functions.FunctionNames.abs;
 import static org.rumbledb.runtime.functions.base.Functions.FunctionNames.accumulate;, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
