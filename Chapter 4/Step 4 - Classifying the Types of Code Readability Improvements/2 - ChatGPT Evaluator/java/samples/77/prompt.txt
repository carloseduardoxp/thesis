Based on this pull request with the developer description: I struggled quite a bit to understand what the parameter value `3` of the `gpioCfgInterfaces` call actually means. So in my first commit I m suggesting to dissolve the magic value `3` by using new constants that I m adding to `PiGpioConst`. I ve taken the constants from https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/blob/master/pigpio.h., the code was changed by the developer from int rslt = PIGPIO.gpioCfgInterfaces(3); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to int rslt = PIGPIO.gpioCfgInterfaces(PI_IF_DISABLE_FIFO | PI_IF_DISABLE_SOCK);, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
