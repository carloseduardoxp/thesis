Based on this pull request with the developer description: Replaced magic constant on CreateTimerPanel with a specific variable for readability, the code was changed by the developer from durationTextField.setText(td.getTimeToFinish().get(Calendar.HOUR) + ":" + (td.getTimeToFinish().get(Calendar.MINUTE) > 9 ? "" : "0") + td.getTimeToFinish().get(Calendar.MINUTE) + (td.getTimeToFinish().get(Calendar.AM_PM) == 0 ? "am" : "pm")); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to durationTextField.setText(td.getTimeToFinish().get(Calendar.HOUR) + ":" + (td.getTimeToFinish().get(Calendar.MINUTE) > 9 ?
