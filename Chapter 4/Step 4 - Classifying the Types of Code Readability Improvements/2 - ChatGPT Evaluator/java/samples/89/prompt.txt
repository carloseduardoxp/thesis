Based on this pull request with the developer description: Use Hamcrest matchers and assertThat() in ReindexRenamedSettingTests to improve readability. Reason: The order of the assertEquals() arguments in ReindexRenamedSettingTests class is reversed., the code was changed by the developer from assertTrue( (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat; assertThat(, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
