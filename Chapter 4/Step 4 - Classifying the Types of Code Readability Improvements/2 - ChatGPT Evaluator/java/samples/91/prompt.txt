Based on this pull request with the developer description: Introduce AssertJ for better test code readability when it comes to testing as it's very expressive and makes the code easy to read., the code was changed by the developer from assertEquals("Ref not found",
         assertThrows(NessieNotFoundException.class,
             () -> paginator.generateStream("ref", OptionalInt.empty())).getMessage()); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;     assertThatThrownBy(() -> paginator.generateStream("ref", OptionalInt.empty()))         .isInstanceOf(NessieNotFoundException.class)         .hasMessage("Ref not found");, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
