Based on this pull request with the developer description: use Collections.singletonList instead of Arrays.asList, the code was changed by the developer from import static java.util.Arrays.asList;  return protocols(asList(protocolConfig)); (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to import static java.util.Collections.singletonList; return protocols(singletonList(protocolConfig));, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
