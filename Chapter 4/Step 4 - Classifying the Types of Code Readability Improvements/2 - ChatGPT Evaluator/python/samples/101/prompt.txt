Based on this pull request with the developer description: I've had a few people ask what these hard coded constants are in the tokenizer and I think this improves that a great deal., the code was changed by the developer from return [49406] + bpe_tokens + [49407] (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return [self.start_of_text] + bpe_tokens + [self.end_of_text], (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
