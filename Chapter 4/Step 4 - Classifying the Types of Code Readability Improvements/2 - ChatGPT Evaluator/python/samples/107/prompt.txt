Based on this pull request with the developer description: Picking up on an idea I used during my [dogfooding of the "Introduction to `iiif-prezi3`" lightning talk](https://digitaldogsbody.net/iiif/prezi3): due to the structure of the recipes, there are a lot of `id` fields that have a common start, so this PR adds a `base_url` variable and uses it in the various bits of manifest data, meaning that the resulting code looks a bit less cluttered (IMO), the code was changed by the developer from manifest = Manifest(id="https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0001-mvm-image/manifest.json", label="Single Image Example") (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to base_url = "https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0001-mvm-image" manifest = Manifest(id=f"{base_url}/manifest.json", label="Single Image Example"), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
