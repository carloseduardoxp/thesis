Based on this pull request with the developer description: Pure MAINT:   minimally change the looping logic into test parametrization, the code was changed by the developer from def _test_factory(case, atol): (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to @pytest.mark.parametrize("j, case", enumerate(cases))     def test_solve_discrete_are(self, j, case):, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
