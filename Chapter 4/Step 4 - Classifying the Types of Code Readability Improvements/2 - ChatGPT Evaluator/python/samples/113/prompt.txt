Based on this pull request with the developer description: Use set operations in tests for readability I opted to use methods instead of operators partly because there is no operator equivalent for `isdisjoint()` (and partly because I prefer them)., the code was changed by the developer from assert all(item in installed for item in kwargs.items()), \ (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to assert set(kwargs.items()) <= installed, \, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
