Based on this pull request with the developer description: Improved readability of regular expression      By removing single charecter alternation     And keeping a charecter set instead, the code was changed by the developer from x_offset, y_offset = map(int, re.split(";|,|-", value)) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to x_offset, y_offset = map(int, re.split(r"[;,\-]", value)), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
