Based on this pull request with the developer description: Underscore-prefixed functions are automatically hidden from generated documentation. `lax` is a semi-public API, so this is a first step towards making its documentation useful., the code was changed by the developer from class OpaqueParam(object): (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to class _OpaqueParam(object):, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
