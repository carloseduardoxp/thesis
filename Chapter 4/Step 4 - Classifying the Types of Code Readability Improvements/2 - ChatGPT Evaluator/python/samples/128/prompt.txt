Based on this pull request with the developer description: Also, 1e6 is easier for a human to parse than counting zeros in 1000000., the code was changed by the developer from pre_move_time = int((time.perf_counter_ns() - start_time) / 1000000) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to pre_move_time = int((time.perf_counter_ns() - start_time) / 1e6), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
