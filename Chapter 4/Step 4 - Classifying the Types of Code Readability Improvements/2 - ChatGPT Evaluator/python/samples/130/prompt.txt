Based on this pull request with the developer description: Optimize the get_prompt function by using a dictionary to map ActionType to hints, thus avoiding repetitions and making the code more readable and maintainable., the code was changed by the developer from if current_task is not None:
         if latest_action_id == '':
             hint = "You haven't taken any actions yet. Start by using `ls` to check out what files you're working with."
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.RUN:
             hint = 'You should think about the command you just ran, what output it gave, and how that affects your plan.'
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.READ:
             hint = 'You should think about the file you just read, what you learned from it, and how that affects your plan.'
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.WRITE:
             hint = 'You just changed a file. You should think about how it affects your plan.'
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.BROWSE:
             hint = 'You should think about the page you just visited, and what you learned from it.'
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.THINK:
             hint = "Look at your last thought in the history above. What does it suggest? Don't think anymore--take action."
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.RECALL:
             hint = 'You should think about the information you just recalled, and how it should affect your plan.'
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.ADD_TASK:
             hint = 'You should think about the next action to take.'
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.MODIFY_TASK:
             hint = 'You should think about the next action to take.'
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.SUMMARIZE:
             hint = ''
         elif latest_action_id == ActionType.FINISH:
             hint = '' (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to def get_hint(latest_action_id: str) -> str:
     """ Returns action type hint based on given action_id """
 
     hints = {
         '': 'You haven\'t taken any actions yet. Start by using `ls` to check out what files you\'re working with.',
         ActionType.RUN: 'You should think about the command you just ran, what output it gave, and how that affects your plan.',
         ActionType.READ: 'You should think about the file you just read, what you learned from it, and how that affects your plan.',
         ActionType.WRITE: 'You just changed a file. You should think about how it affects your plan.',
         ActionType.BROWSE: 'You should think about the page you just visited, and what you learned from it.',
         ActionType.THINK: 'Look at your last thought in the history above. What does it suggest? Don\'t think anymore--take action.',
         ActionType.RECALL: 'You should think about the information you just recalled, and how it should affect your plan.',
         ActionType.ADD_TASK: 'You should think about the next action to take.',
         ActionType.MODIFY_TASK: 'You should think about the next action to take.',
         ActionType.SUMMARIZE: '',
         ActionType.FINISH: '',
     }
     return hints.get(latest_action_id, ''), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
