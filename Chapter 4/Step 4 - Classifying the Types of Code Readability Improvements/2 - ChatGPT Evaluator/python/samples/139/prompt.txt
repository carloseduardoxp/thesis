Based on this pull request with the developer description: When I worked on PR #750 based on the implemention of the `grdview` function, I found that the `grdview` codes are a little difficult to understand. The main reason is that `contextlib.ExitStack()` is new to me. Another reason is that these two codes `fname = stack.enter_context(file_context)` and `arg_str = " ".join([fname, build_arg_string(kwargs)])` are separated by the long `if` block., the code was changed by the developer from drapefile = stack.enter_context(drape_context)
                             kwargs["G"] = drapefile (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to kwargs["G"] = stack.enter_context(drape_context), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
