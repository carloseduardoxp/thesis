Based on this pull request with the developer description: code readability improvements [e.g., replacing long attributes such as `self.prior.kernel(...)` with `kernel = self.prior.kernel` then `kernel(...)`]., the code was changed by the developer from gram, cross_covariance = (
             self.prior.kernel.gram,
             self.prior.kernel.cross_covariance,
         ) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to kernel = self.prior.kernel         gram = kernel.gram, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
