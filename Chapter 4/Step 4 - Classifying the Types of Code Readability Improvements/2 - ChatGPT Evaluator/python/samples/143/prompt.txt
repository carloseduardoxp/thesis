Based on this pull request with the developer description: Honestly I had no idea what `torch.ones([]) * self.config.logit_scale_init_value` would return - it's not documented either.    ~Proposing to change it to a very clear `torch.tensor(1.0)` which leaves no doubt to what it does.~    Proposing to change it to a very clear `torch.tensor(self.config.logit_scale_init_value)` which leaves no doubt to what it does., the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
