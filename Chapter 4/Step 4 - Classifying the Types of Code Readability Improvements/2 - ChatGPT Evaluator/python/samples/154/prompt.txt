Based on this pull request with the developer description: This removes lambdas, the code was changed by the developer from letters = traverse_tree(root, "") with open(file_path) as f:         while True:             c = f.read(1)             if not c:                 break             le = list(filter(lambda l: l.letter == c, letters))[0]             print(le.bitstring, end=" ") (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to letters = {         k: v for letter in traverse_tree(root, "") for k, v in letter.bitstring.items()     }     print(f"Huffman Coding  of {file_path}: ")     with open(file_path) as f:         while True:             c = f.read(1)             if not c:                 break, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
