Based on this pull request with the developer description: Improve readability by packing frequently used variables into namedtuples., the code was changed by the developer from def new_state(     q: TensorVariable, logprob_fn: Callable ) -> Tuple[TensorVariable, TensorVariable, TensorVariable]: (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to def new_state(q: TensorVariable, logprob_fn: Callable) -> IntegratorState:, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
