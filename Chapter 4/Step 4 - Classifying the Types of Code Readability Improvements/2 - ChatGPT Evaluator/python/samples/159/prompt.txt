Based on this pull request with the developer description: I also made a few other minor tweaks (use f-strings, etc.), the code was changed by the developer from "No node on the input graph is labeled by '" + label_name + "'." (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to f"No node on the input graph is labeled by '{label_name}'.", (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
