Based on this pull request with the developer description: ensuring consistent variable naming across _clip_gdf_with_mask and clip functions by renaming the "mask_is_list_like" variable to "clipping_by_rectangle", the code was changed by the developer from mask_is_list_like = _mask_is_list_like_rectangle(mask) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to clipping_by_rectangle = _mask_is_list_like_rectangle(mask), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
