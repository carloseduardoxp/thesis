Based on this pull request with the developer description: Reformatted files for better readability and according to latest Python standards by using f-strings instead of the old literal formatting method. To do this I used the automated tool [Flynt], the code was changed by the developer from "Input needs to be a scalar DNDarray,but was found to be {}d DNDarray".format(x.ndim) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to f"Input needs to be a scalar DNDarray,but was found to be {x.ndim}d DNDarray", (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
