Based on this pull request with the developer description: merge insertErrors logic., the code was changed by the developer from if not result:        
    result = response
 else:
    new_errors = response.get('insertErrors')
    if not new_errors:
       continue
 
    if result.get('insertErrors'):
       result['insertErrors'].extend(new_errors)
    else:
       result['insertErrors'] = new_errors (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if not result:        
    result = response
    continue
 
 new_errors = response.get('insertErrors')
 if not new_errors:
    continue
 
 result.setdefault('insertErrors', []).extend(new_errors), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
