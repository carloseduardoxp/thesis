Based on this pull request with the developer description: Consolidated into a single if..elif structure, replacing multiple parallel if statements, the code was changed by the developer from elif isinstance(event, MessageAction):
       if event.source == EventSource.USER:
             logger.info(
                  event,
                  extra={'msg_type': 'ACTION', 'event_source': EventSource.USER},
             )
             if self.get_agent_state() != AgentState.RUNNING:
                  await self.set_agent_state_to(AgentState.RUNNING) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if isinstance(event, Action):
      await self._handle_action(event)
 elif isinstance(event, Observation):
      await self._handle_observation(event), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
