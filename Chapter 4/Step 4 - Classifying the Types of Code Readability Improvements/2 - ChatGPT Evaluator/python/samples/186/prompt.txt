Based on this pull request with the developer description: if conditions could be merged. So, I merged them., the code was changed by the developer from if self.tol is not None:       if diff < self.tol:             self.n_iter = i + 1             self.__theta = theta             break (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if self.tol is not None and diff < self.tol:      self.n_iter = i + 1      self.__theta = theta      break, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
