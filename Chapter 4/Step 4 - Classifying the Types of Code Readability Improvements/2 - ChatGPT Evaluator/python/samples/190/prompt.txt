Based on this pull request with the developer description: Simplify move overhead calculation, the code was changed by the developer from wtime = game.state["wtime"] btime = game.state["btime"] pre_move_time = int((time.perf_counter_ns() - start_time) / 1000000) if board.turn == chess.WHITE:     wtime = max(0, wtime - move_overhead - pre_move_time) else:     btime = max(0, btime - move_overhead - pre_move_time) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to pre_move_time = int((time.perf_counter_ns() - start_time) / 1e6) overhead = pre_move_time + move_overhead wb = "w" if board.turn == chess.WHITE else "b" game.state[f"{wb}time"] = max(0, game.state[f"{wb}time"] - overhead), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
