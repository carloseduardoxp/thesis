Based on this pull request with the developer description: The only point to using it is with `break`. (but it doesn't lead to a bug, just a harder to understand the code) So I'm proposing to remove the `else` control and just run the code in its branch normally since it *always* gets executed as there is no `break` statement.    And the objective of this code is to always be run if I understand it correctly. So let's make it loud and clear., the code was changed by the developer from else:
                 self.parts = ds_utils.partition_balanced(weights=binary_weights,
                                                          num_parts=num_stages) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to self.parts = ds_utils.partition_balanced(weights=binary_weights,
                                                      num_parts=num_stages), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
