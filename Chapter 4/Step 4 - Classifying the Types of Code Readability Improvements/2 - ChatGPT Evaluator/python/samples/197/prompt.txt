Based on this pull request with the developer description: Slightly improve readability in reading finite-fault data when the shakemap is missing, the code was changed by the developer from else:       shakemap = [] (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return load_rupdic_from_finite_fault(usgs_id, mag, products), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
