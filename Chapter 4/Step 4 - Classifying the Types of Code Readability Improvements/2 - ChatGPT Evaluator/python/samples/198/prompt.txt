Based on this pull request with the developer description: Combined checks for str, int, and tuple into a single isinstance call using a tuple of types.
 This reduces redundancy, improves clarity and performance . The TypeError is preserved to handle unsupported types., the code was changed by the developer from def coerce_to_str(some_object: Union[str, int, tuple]):     if isinstance(some_object, str):         return some_object     if isinstance(some_object, int):         return str(some_object)     if isinstance(some_object, tuple):         return str(some_object) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to def coerce_to_str(some_object: Union[str, int, tuple]) -> str:     if isinstance(some_object, (str, int, tuple)):, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
