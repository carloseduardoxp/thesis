Based on this pull request with the developer description: decouples attribute assignment from code logic, the code was changed by the developer from if not self.args.model_parallel:      self.model = model.to(args.device) if model is not None else None else:      self.model = model if model is not None else None (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if model is not None and not self.args.model_parallel:      model = model.to(args.device)  self.model = model, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
