Based on this pull request with the developer description: group the conditions with parenthesis for better readability., the code was changed by the developer from all_unified_packages = [name for name in files_in_bucket if f'{scylla_product}-{arch}-unified-package' in name or                             (f'{scylla_product}-unified' in name and arch in name) or                             (f'{scylla_product}-unified' in name and all([known_arch not in name for known_arch in known_archs]))                             ] (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to all_unified_packages = [name for name in files_in_bucket if                             (                                 # let's accept all unified packages namings:                                 # 'scylla-x86_64-unified-package-5.1.2-0.20221225.4c0f7ea09893-5.1.2.0.20221225.4c0f7ea09893.tar.gz'                                 # 'scylla-x86_64-unified-package-5.1.3-0.20230112.addc4666d502-5.1.3.0.20230112.addc4666d502.tar.gz'                                 (f'{scylla_product}-{arch}-unified-package' in name) or                                 # newer versions (6.0/2024.2 and up) might look like:                                 # 'scylla-unified-package-6.0.0~rc0-0.20231219.c7cdb16538f2.x86_64.tar.gz'                                 (f'{scylla_product}-unified' in name and arch in name) or                                 # older versions unified packages might look like                                 # 'scylla-unified-package-4.3.0~rc0-0.20220810.86a6c1fb2b79.tar.gz'                                 (f'{scylla_product}-unified' in name and all([known_arch not in name for known_arch in known_archs]))                             )], (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer.
