Based on this pull request with the developer description: simplified add_tool for improved readability, the code was changed by the developer from if issubclass(tool, FileSearch):             # check that tools name is not already in tools             for t in self.tools:                 if issubclass(t, FileSearch):                     return             self.tools.append(tool)         elif issubclass(tool, CodeInterpreter):             for t in self.tools:                 if issubclass(t, CodeInterpreter):                     return             self.tools.append(tool)         elif issubclass(tool, Retrieval):             for t in self.tools:                 if issubclass(t, Retrieval):                     return             self.tools.append(tool) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to subclasses = [FileSearch, CodeInterpreter, Retrieval]         for subclass in subclasses:             if issubclass(tool, subclass):                 if not any(issubclass(t, subclass) for t in self.tools):                     self.tools.append(tool)                 return, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
