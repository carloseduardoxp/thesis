Based on this pull request with the developer description: simplify loop with `any` call, the code was changed by the developer from for possibleMsg in ["not exist", "not found", "No such file or directory"]:
             if possibleMsg in errorMsg:
                 return True
 
         return False (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return any(possibleMsg in errorMsg for possibleMsg in ["not exist", "not found", "No such file or directory"]), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
