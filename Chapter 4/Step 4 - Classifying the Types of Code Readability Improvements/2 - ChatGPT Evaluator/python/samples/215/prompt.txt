Based on this pull request with the developer description: Replaced unnecessary conversion to list with a set data structure. `target_urls` are not being accessed by index after removing duplicates. Code in`github_scrapers`:        Old code: `target_urls = list(set(target_urls))`        New Code: `target_urls = set(target_urls)`       Reduces memory usage by avoiding redundant data storage., the code was changed by the developer from target_urls = list(set(target_urls)) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to target_urls = set(target_urls), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
