Based on this pull request with the developer description: The Path() constructor already handles both str and Path types effectively., the code was changed by the developer from path_obj = _coerce_str_or_path_to_path(should_be_path)  def _coerce_str_or_path_to_path(should_be_path: Union[Path, str]) -> Path:
     wrong_type_msg = "Unexpected type for something that should be convertable to a Path: "
     if isinstance(should_be_path, str):
         return Path(should_be_path)
     elif isinstance(should_be_path, Path):
         return should_be_path
     else:
         raise TypeError(wrong_type_msg + str(type(should_be_path))) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to path_obj = Path(should_be_path), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
