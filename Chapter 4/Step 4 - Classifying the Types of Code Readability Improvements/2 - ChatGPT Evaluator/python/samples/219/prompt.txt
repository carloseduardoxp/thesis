Based on this pull request with the developer description: on `standard_paths function`:      * I used `os.path.isdir` instead of `try: ... except OSError: pass`  for checking if `lib-dynload` exists., the code was changed by the developer from if '.' in name and name.rsplit('.')[-1] not in ['so', 'py', 'pyc']: (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if '.' in name and not name.endswith(("so", "py", "pyc")):, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
