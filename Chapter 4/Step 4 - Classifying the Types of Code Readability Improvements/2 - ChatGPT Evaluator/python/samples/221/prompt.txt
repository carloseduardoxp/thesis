Based on this pull request with the developer description: use `str.endswith()` instead of string comparison by range (**L23**), the code was changed by the developer from if module == '__init__.py' or module[-3:] != '.py' or module == '__pycache__': (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if module == '__init__.py' or not module.endswith('.py') or module == '__pycache__':, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
