Based on this pull request with the developer description: change to import name of `CSET.recipes` during testing. Just a minor cleanup to readability., the code was changed by the developer from import CSET.recipes files = CSET.recipes._recipe_files_in_tree(input_dir=Path("tests")) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to from CSET import recipes files = recipes._recipe_files_in_tree(input_dir=Path("tests")), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
