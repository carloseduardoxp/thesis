Based on this pull request with the developer description: Rm unnecessary binding of local variable., the code was changed by the developer from predicted = label_dict[np.argmax(F, axis=1)].tolist()
 
     return predicted (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return label_dict[np.argmax(F, axis=1)].tolist(), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
