Based on this pull request with the developer description: the `node_classification` package was implemented in such a way that there were a lot of simple (one-or-few-liner) expressions that were wrapped up in "helper" functions. In principle this was done because the functionality was reused in both the `harmonic_function` and `local_and_global_consistency` functions, but IMO the code is improved by reducing the indirection introduced by all the utility functions., the code was changed by the developer from from networkx.algorithms.node_classification.utils import (     _get_label_info,     _init_label_matrix,     _propagate,     _predict, ) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to from networkx.algorithms.node_classification.utils import _get_label_info, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
