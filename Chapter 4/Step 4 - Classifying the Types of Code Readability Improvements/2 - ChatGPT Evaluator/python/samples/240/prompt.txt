Based on this pull request with the developer description: In the "top-level" ThreadPoolExecutor used for threading plugin execution, increase readability and reliability by wrapping it in a with context manager, so that the pool's cleanup is run in all situations explicitly., the code was changed by the developer from self.plugpool = ThreadPoolExecutor(self.opts.threads)             # Pass the plugpool its own private copy of self.pluglist             results = self.plugpool.map(self._collect_plugin,                                         list(self.pluglist))             self.plugpool.shutdown(wait=True) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to results = []             with ThreadPoolExecutor(self.opts.threads) as executor:                 results = executor.map(self._collect_plugin,                                        list(self.pluglist)), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
