Based on this pull request with the developer description: Save `centroids` and `embeddings` in a dictionary with their "feature_name" as the key. This cleans up some code in `_get_cost_matrix` as well., the code was changed by the developer from current_embeddings, future_embeddings = self._get_curr_futr_feats(             frame, feature_name='embedding')          current_centroids, future_centroids = self._get_curr_futr_feats(             frame, feature_name='centroid')          current_emb_array = np.stack([current_embeddings[k] for k in current_embeddings], axis=0)         future_emb_array = np.stack([future_embeddings[k] for k in future_embeddings], axis=0)          current_cent_array = np.stack([current_centroids[k] for k in current_centroids], axis=0)         future_cent_array = np.stack([future_centroids[k] for k in future_centroids], axis=0)          assignment_shape = (len(current_embeddings), len(future_embeddings))         assignment_matrix = np.zeros(assignment_shape, dtype=self.dtype)          # Add time dimension         future_emb_array = np.expand_dims(future_emb_array, axis=1)         future_cent_array = np.expand_dims(future_cent_array, axis=1)          # Add batch dimension         current_emb_array = np.expand_dims(current_emb_array, axis=0)         future_emb_array = np.expand_dims(future_emb_array, axis=0)         current_cent_array = np.expand_dims(current_cent_array, axis=0)         future_cent_array = np.expand_dims(future_cent_array, axis=0)          inputs = {'current_embeddings': current_emb_array,                   'current_centroids': current_cent_array,                   'future_embeddings': future_emb_array,                   'future_centroids': future_cent_array} (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to inputs = {}         relevant_tracks = []         for feature_name in self.features:             # Get the embeddings for previously tracked cells             current_feature = self._fetch_tracked_features(                 before_frame=frame, feature_name=feature_name)              # Get the embeddings for the current frame             future_feature = self._get_frame_features(                 frame=frame, feature_name=feature_name)              if not relevant_tracks:                 for track_id in current_feature:                     relevant_tracks.append(track_id)              # Convert from dict to arrays             current_feature_arr = np.stack([                 current_feature[k] for k in current_feature             ], axis=0)             future_feature_arr = np.stack([                 future_feature[k] for k in future_feature             ], axis=0)              # Add time dimension             future_feature_arr = np.expand_dims(future_feature_arr, axis=1)              # Add batch dimension             current_feature_arr = np.expand_dims(current_feature_arr, axis=0)             future_feature_arr = np.expand_dims(future_feature_arr, axis=0)              # Add feature to inputs             # model expects "current_embeddings" but feature_name is "embedding"             # TODO: this name is hardcoded based on a model from deepcell-tf             inputs['current_{}s'.format(feature_name)] = current_feature_arr             inputs['future_{}s'.format(feature_name)] = future_feature_arr, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
