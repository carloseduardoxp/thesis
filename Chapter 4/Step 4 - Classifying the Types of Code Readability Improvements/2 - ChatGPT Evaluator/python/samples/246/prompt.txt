Based on this pull request with the developer description: This PR improves readability for backend tests.Since CNTK added, it becomes hard to add something into backend tests due to many hardcoded and cntk-specific patchwork. I think it is better to clean up the current tests first in order to write new tests for increasing test coverages. Especially, this PR focuses on integration of `cntk_check_*_tensor_operation` into `check_*_tensor_operation`., the code was changed by the developer from def check_single_tensor_operation(function_name, input_shape, backend_list, **kwargs):  for i in range(len(z_list) - 1):         assert z_list[i].shape == z_list[i + 1].shape         assert_allclose(z_list[i], z_list[i + 1], atol=1e-05)         if hasattr(z_list[i], '_keras_shape'):             assert z_list[i]._keras_shape == z_list[i].shape  def check_two_tensor_operation(function_name, x_input_shape,
                                y_input_shape, backend_list, **kwargs): for i in range(len(z_list) - 1):
         assert z_list[i].shape == z_list[i + 1].shape
         assert_allclose(z_list[i], z_list[i + 1], atol=1e-05)
         if hasattr(z_list[i], '_keras_shape'):
             assert z_list[i]._keras_shape == z_list[i].shape (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
