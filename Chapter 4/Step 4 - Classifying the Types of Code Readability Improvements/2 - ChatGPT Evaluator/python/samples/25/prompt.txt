Based on this pull request with the developer description: I have changed the "Head" to "head"(making it more Pythonic) and also "tamp" to "temp"(Better readability) in singly linked list(under data structures), the code was changed by the developer from self.Head = None  # Initialize Head to None (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to self.head = None  # Initialize head to None, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
