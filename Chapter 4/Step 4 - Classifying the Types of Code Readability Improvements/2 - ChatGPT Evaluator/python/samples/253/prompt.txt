Based on this pull request with the developer description: I rewrote the test because I was going to add zarr as another test case, then decided OME-Zarr warrants its own operator and won't go here.    I think the refactoring is still helpful in its own right. It makes the difference between the test cases clearer, and makes sure the h5 and n5 tests don't depend on each other (plus it's a bit shorter :smile: ).    The actual test cases covered and how they're implemented could be improved I think. I'm also not sure about the value of the third test using `.Output.meta.ram_usage_per_requested_pixel = 1000000.0` to force writing in tiny blocks. This test takes 0.5s to run, which is a long time for a test case that seems unnecessary to cover to me. But I intentionally purely refactored here to make review easier., the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
