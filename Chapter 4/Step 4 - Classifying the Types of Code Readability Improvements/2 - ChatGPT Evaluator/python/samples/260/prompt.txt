Based on this pull request with the developer description: `interview.file_name` was never used. Made clearer which label is being used where by using `interview_label` directly, and basing new `package_title` off of the `interview_label` to reduce chance of errors in the 2-3 places we were previously using the same regex to get the package title., the code was changed by the developer from def yaml_file_name(self)->str:
         return to_yaml_file(self.file_name) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
