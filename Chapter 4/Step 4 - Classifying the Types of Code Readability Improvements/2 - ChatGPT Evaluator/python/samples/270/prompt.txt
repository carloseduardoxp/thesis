Based on this pull request with the developer description: raise `NotFound` if no dag return based on the given `dag_id`, the code was changed by the developer from try:         dag = current_app.dag_bag.get_dag(dag_id)         if not dag:             raise NotFound(error_message)     except SerializedDagNotFound:                raise NotFound(error_message) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to dag = current_app.dag_bag.get_dag(dag_id)
     if not dag:
         raise NotFound(error_message), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
