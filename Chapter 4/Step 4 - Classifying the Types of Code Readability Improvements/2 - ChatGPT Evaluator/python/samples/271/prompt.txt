Based on this pull request with the developer description: Removed SkipLines function and implemented the same functionality through the more concise `filter` function  - fix: removed extraneous filter, the code was changed by the developer from for ignored in FLAGS.ignore_directories:     policy_directories = filter(       lambda path: not path.match('%s/**/pol' % ignored_directory) and       not path.match('%s/pol' % ignored_directory),       policy_directories     )     policy_directories = filter(       lambda path: not path.match('%s/pol' % ignored_directory), (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to for ignored in FLAGS.ignore_directories:         lambda path: not path.match('%s/**/pol' % ignored) and not path.match('%s/pol' % ignored),, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
