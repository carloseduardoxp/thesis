Based on this pull request with the developer description: Remove inverse of g constant - Inverse of g can be easier calculated when needed and does not have to be export with constants., the code was changed by the developer from G_INV: Final[int] = pow(G, -1, P) ginv = int_to_p_unchecked(G_INV) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to g_inv = int_to_p_unchecked(pow(G, -1, P)), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
