Based on this pull request with the developer description: Replace long lambda with local function, the code was changed by the developer from get_greeting = lambda greeting: str(greeting_cfg.get(greeting) or "").format_map(keyword_map) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to def get_greeting(greeting):
         return str(greeting_cfg.get(greeting) or "").format_map(keyword_map), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
