Based on this pull request with the developer description: Move the course copy logic to a private function., the code was changed by the developer from if not effective_page_id:             found_page = course_copy_plugin.find_matching_page_in_course(                 document_page_id, current_course_id             )             if not found_page:                 # We couldn't fix course copy, there might be something else going on                 # or maybe teacher never launched before a student.                 LOG.debug(                     "Via URL for page, couldn't find page in the new course. Document: %s, course: %s.",                     document_url,                     current_course_id,                 )                 raise PageNotFoundInCourse(                     "moodle_page_not_found_in_course", document_page_id                 )              # Store a mapping so we don't have to re-search next time.             current_course.set_mapped_page_id(document_page_id, found_page.lms_id)             effective_page_id = found_page.lms_id             LOG.debug(                 "Via URL for page, found page in the new course.
