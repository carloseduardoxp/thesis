Based on this pull request with the developer description: Extract out `_grad_transform_jac_via_callaback` and `_device_method_jac_via_callback` to being global functions with explicit argument lists, instead of depending on closure. This reduces nesting, allows the functions to be experimented on and tested independently, and makes the dependencies explicit. The previous syntax also called local variables like `params` the same thing as a parameter from outer scope., the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
