Based on this pull request with the developer description: For exports and variables we want a type and usage to accompany the proof types. This change is significant because it changes the proofs from NameTuples to frozen dataclasses. This gives the same immutability but the flexibility to have non essential information stored for serializing., the code was changed by the developer from class DisjunctiveChaumPedersenProof(NamedTuple): (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to @dataclass(frozen=True)
 class DisjunctiveChaumPedersenProof(Proof):, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
