Based on this pull request with the developer description: A few more docstrings with examples and adding some explicit documentation on closure variables to docstrings., the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to # execute_wrapper_jvp merely registered, not used.
     # pylint: disable=unused-variable, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
