Based on this pull request with the developer description: Use `:ivar:` to document class fields.        Using class fields documentation renders the code less readable. In my last commit, I introduced such documentation type.        This commit is to use the `:ivar:` tag to document a class field.    The last SPDX package objects added (`PackageComment` and `PackaheHomePage`) had an invalid JSON representation.    The tag for `PackageComment` is `"comment"`, not `"comments"`.  The tag for `PackageHomePage` is `"homepage"`, not `"homePage"`., the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
