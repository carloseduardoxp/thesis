Based on this pull request with the developer description: I suggest some improvements in clarity in the documentation for `permutation_test_score`.    changes include:  - clarify in Userguide that `permutation_test_score` can be used on more than on classifiers  - mentioning `n_jobs` after sentence on brute force procedure  - readability on some difficult to understand sentences  - in example, clear distinguishing between original data and data without permutations (as the term "original data" was used in two different contexts for different things)  - add conclusions on results from `permutation_test_score` in example: what does the result infer for the null hypothesis?  - call p_value a proportion instead of a percentage, the code was changed by the developer from  (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to , (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
