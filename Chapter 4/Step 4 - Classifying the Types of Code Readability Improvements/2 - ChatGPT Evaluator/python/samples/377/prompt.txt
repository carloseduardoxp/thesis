Based on this pull request with the developer description: and fixed the docstrings up a bit, the code was changed by the developer from predicted : array, shape = [n_samples]
         Array of predicted labels (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to predicted : list
         List of length ``len(G)`` with the predicted labels for each node., (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
