Based on this pull request with the developer description: I added some newlines to make it easier for me to read., the code was changed by the developer from return [[user.user_id, user.username, user.num_forms_submitted, user.delta_forms,
                     user.num_forms_submitted_next_month, user.delta_forms_next_month,
                     user.is_performing] for user in user_list] (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to return [[
                 user.user_id,
                 user.username,
                 user.num_forms_submitted,
                 user.delta_forms,
                 user.num_forms_submitted_next_month,
                 user.delta_forms_next_month,
                 user.is_performing,
             ] for user in user_list], (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
