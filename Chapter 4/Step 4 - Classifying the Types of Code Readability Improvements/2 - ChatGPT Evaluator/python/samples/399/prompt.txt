Based on this pull request with the developer description: use line-length=120 for better code readability, the code was changed by the developer from stm = Episodes.__table__.insert().values(
         series_id=3, season_id=6, episode_id=1, title="TBD"
     ) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to stm = Episodes.__table__.insert().values(series_id=3, season_id=6, episode_id=1, title="TBD"), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer.
