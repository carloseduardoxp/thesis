Based on this pull request with the developer description: Limit interview_label length for readability, Because 50 characters is still extraordinarily long and will render a lot of lines unreadable in the YAML, limiting to 35 characters instead., the code was changed by the developer from ${ action_button_html(interview_url(reset=1, i="docassemble." + space_to_underscore(re.sub("\W","",interview.title)) + ":data/questions/" + interview.file_name + '.yml'), label = "Run interview", new_window=True ) } (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to ${ action_button_html(interview_url(reset=1, i="docassemble." + package_title + ":data/questions/" + interview_label + '.yml'), label = "Run interview", new_window=True ) }, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
