Based on this pull request with the developer description: Global variables that were still lowercase were made uppercase to clearly distinguish them from local variables., the code was changed by the developer from global myproxy (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to global MYPROXY, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
