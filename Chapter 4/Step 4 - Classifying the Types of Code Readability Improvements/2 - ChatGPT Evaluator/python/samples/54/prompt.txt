Based on this pull request with the developer description: Replace eval with converting object to bytes, the code was changed by the developer from if event == "end":
        yield eval(f'b\'{{"type":"gameState","moves":"{moves}","wtime":{int(wtime * 1000)},"btime":{int(btime * 1000)},"winc":2000,"binc":2000,"status":"outoftime","winner":"black"}}\'') (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to new_game_state = {"type": "gameState",                               "moves": moves,                               "wtime": int(wtime * 1000),                               "btime": int(btime * 1000),                               "winc": 2000,                               "binc": 2000} if event == "end":     new_game_state["status"] = "outoftime"     new_game_state["winner"] = "black"     yield json.dumps(new_game_state).encode("utf-8"), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
