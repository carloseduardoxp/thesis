Based on this pull request with the developer description: updated hyperopt loss sharpe loss method for better readability to make it more consistent with the final version of sharpe loss daily loss method., the code was changed by the developer from if (np.std(total_profit) != 0.):
             sharp_ratio = expected_yearly_return / np.std(total_profit) * np.sqrt(365) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to up_stdev = np.std(total_profit) if (np.std(total_profit) != 0.):
             sharp_ratio = expected_returns_mean / up_stdev * np.sqrt(365), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
