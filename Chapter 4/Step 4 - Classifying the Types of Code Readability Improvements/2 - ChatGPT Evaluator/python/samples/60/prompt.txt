Based on this pull request with the developer description: I added the casting method to Stable Diffusion source as y-vectorfield-fj(my previous account name)., the code was changed by the developer from latent = ops.cast(latent, latent_prev.dtype) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to target_dtype = latent_prev.dtype
             latent = ops.cast(latent, target_dtype), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
