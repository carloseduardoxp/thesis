Based on this pull request with the developer description: `opi/__init__.py`  - saving the results of `get_cpu_arch()` in a variable to reuse them (**L307-320**), the code was changed by the developer from if binary_data['arch'] not in (get_cpu_arch(), 'noarch'): (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to cpu_arch = get_cpu_arch()
    if binary_data['arch'] not in (cpu_arch, 'noarch'):, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
