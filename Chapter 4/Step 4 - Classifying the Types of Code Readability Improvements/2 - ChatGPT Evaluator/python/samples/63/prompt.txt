Based on this pull request with the developer description: stage[0] is assumed to be for sources, 1: and onwards is  patches/resources, make that a bit more clear.    the implementation isn't very satisfactory cause it fetches  some (unconditional) patches too, but does not apply them, because  that requires a concrete spec.    patches are only applied upon install, at which point even  more may be fetched..., the code was changed by the developer from if isinstance(package.stage[0].fetcher, spack.fetch_strategy.GitFetchStrategy):
         package.stage[0].fetcher.get_full_repo = True (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to source_stage = package.stage[0]
     if isinstance(source_stage.fetcher, spack.fetch_strategy.GitFetchStrategy):
         source_stage.fetcher.get_full_repo = True, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
