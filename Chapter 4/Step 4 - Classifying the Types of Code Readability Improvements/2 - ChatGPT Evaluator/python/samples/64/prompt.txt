Based on this pull request with the developer description: Breaks the `seed_offset` into two lines. The first does the hashing (and uses the default encoding). The second maps the hashed value to an integer (making the `base` argument explicit)., the code was changed by the developer from seed_offset = int(hashlib.md5(module_name.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest(), 16) (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to hashed_name = hashlib.md5(module_name.encode())
         seed_offset = int(hashed_name.hexdigest(), base=16), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
