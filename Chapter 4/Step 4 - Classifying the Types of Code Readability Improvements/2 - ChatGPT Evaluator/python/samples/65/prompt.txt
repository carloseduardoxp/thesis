Based on this pull request with the developer description: I am working on adding list of enum support to options, cleaning up the code as I try to figure out how things work., the code was changed by the developer from merged_val = [
                 self._convert_member_type(kwargs.get("member_type", str), x) for x in merged_val
             ]
             if kwargs.get("member_type") == shell_str: (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to member_type = kwargs.get("member_type", str)
             merged_val = [self._convert_member_type(member_type, val) for val in merged_val]
             if member_type == shell_str:, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
