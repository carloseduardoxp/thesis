Based on this pull request with the developer description: access the row fields by field name instead of index., the code was changed by the developer from response = {conn[0] for conn in session.query(Connection.conn_id).all()} (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to connections_ids = {conn.conn_id for conn in session.query(Connection.conn_id)}, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
