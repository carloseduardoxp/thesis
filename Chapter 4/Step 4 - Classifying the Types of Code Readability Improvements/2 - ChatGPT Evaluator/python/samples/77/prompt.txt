Based on this pull request with the developer description: Small internal refactoring to avoid usage of index-based access such as `url[1]` or `response[2]`, hopefully making the HTTP proxy implementation even easier to read. :-), the code was changed by the developer from response[4], connection=connection, callback=self._response_closed (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to (             http_version,             status_code,             reason_phrase,             headers,             stream,         ) = await connection.request(             stream, connection=connection, callback=self._response_closed, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
