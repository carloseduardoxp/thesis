Based on this pull request with the developer description: Address anti-pattern in conditionals: Use `if foo is not None` instead  of `if not foo is None` and `if foo not in (set)` instead of `if not foo  in (set)`., the code was changed by the developer from if not condition_data is None: (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to if condition_data is not None:, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
