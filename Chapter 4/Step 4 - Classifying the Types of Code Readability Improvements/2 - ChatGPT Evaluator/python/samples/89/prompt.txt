Based on this pull request with the developer description: Negated conditions are more difficult to read than positive ones, so it is best to avoid them where we can. By swapping the `if` and `else` conditions around we can invert the condition and make it positive., the code was changed by the developer from sub_count = await inner.utils.count_sub(user_id) if not user_created else 0 (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to sub_count = 0 if user_created else await inner.utils.count_sub(user_id), (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
