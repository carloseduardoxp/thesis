Based on this pull request with the developer description: I used os.path.isdir instead of try: ... except OSError: pass for checking if lib-dynload exists., the code was changed by the developer from try:     for name in os.listdir(os.path.join(path, 'lib-dynload')):            yield name except OSError:  # pragma: no cover     pass (if dont have code before, the code wasnt exist yet) to dynload_path = os.path.join(path, 'lib-dynload')     if os.path.isdir(dynload_path):        for name in os.listdir(dynload_path):                        yield name, (if dont have code after, the code was removed) please, provide the appropriate label that represents the code readability improvement described and performed by the developer. No explanations, only the name of the appropriate label.
