Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {      
        String s = new String("abc\u0000def");
        System.out.println(s.toCharArray());
    }
}                                                               

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S2129 message = Remove this "String" constructor, start line = 4, end line = 4.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
