Given the following Java code snippet:

public class DeepSeek {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String numberStr = "123";
        int number = Integer.parseInt(numberStr);

    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "number"., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "number" local variable., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "number"., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "number" local variable., start line = 7, end line = 7.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
