Given the following Java code snippet:

import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;

// ... inside your doGet() or doPost() method
public class Gemini {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        HttpSession session = request.getSession();
// At this point, 'session' will always be a valid HttpSession object.
// It might be an existing one or a newly created one.

    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "session"., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "session" local variable., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "session"., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "session" local variable., start line = 9, end line = 9.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
