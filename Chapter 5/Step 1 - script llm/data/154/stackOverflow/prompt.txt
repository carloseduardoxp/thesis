Given the following Java code snippet:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Enter your username: ");        
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String myLine = scan.nextLine();
    }
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "myLine"., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "myLine" local variable., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "myLine"., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "myLine" local variable., start line = 9, end line = 9.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
