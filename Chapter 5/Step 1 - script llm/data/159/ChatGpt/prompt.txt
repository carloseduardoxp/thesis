Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num1 = 10;
    double num2 = (double) num1;

  }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "num2"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1905 message = Remove this unnecessary cast to "double"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "num2" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "num2"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1905 message = Remove this unnecessary cast to "double"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "num2" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "num2"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1905 message = Remove this unnecessary cast to "double"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "num2" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
