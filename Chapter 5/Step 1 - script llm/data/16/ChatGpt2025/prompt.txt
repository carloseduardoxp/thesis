Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Chat extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Chat t1 = new Chat(); // create thread
        t1.start(); // start thread
    }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1161 message = Add the "@Override" annotation above this method signature, start line = 2, end line = 2.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
