Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread someThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                runSomething();
            }
        });
        someThread.setDaemon(true);
        someThread.start();
    }

}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1604 message = Make this anonymous inner class a lambda (sonar.java.source not set. Assuming 8 or greater.), start line = 4, end line = 4.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
