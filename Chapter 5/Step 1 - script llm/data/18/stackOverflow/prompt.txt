Given the following Java code snippet:

import java.io.File;

public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

//delete file
        File f = new File("fileToDelete");
        boolean success = f.delete();
    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "success"., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "success" local variable., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "success"., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "success" local variable., start line = 10, end line = 10.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
