Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String str = "This is a string\nwith newlines\n";
    str = str.replace("\n", "");
  }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "str"., start line = 4, end line = 4.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
