Given the following Java code snippet:

public class Chat {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int day = 2;

        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Monday");
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Tuesday");
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Wednesday");
            default:
                System.out.println("Another day");
        }

    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S128 message = End this switch case with an unconditional break, start line = 13, end line = 13, rule key = java:S128 message = End this switch case with an unconditional break, start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S128 message = End this switch case with an unconditional break, start line = 9, end line = 9.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
