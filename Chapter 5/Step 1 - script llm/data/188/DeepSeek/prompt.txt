Given the following Java code snippet:

public class DeepSeek {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

// Generates a random double between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)
        double randomDouble = Math.random();
        System.out.println("Random double: " + randomDouble);

// To get a random integer between 0 and 99:
        int randomInt = (int) (Math.random() * 100);
        System.out.println("Random integer (0-99): " + randomInt);

    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S2140 message = Use "java.util.Random.nextInt()" instead., start line = 11, end line = 11.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
