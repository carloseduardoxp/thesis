Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 1;
    int j = i++; // j is assigned the value of 1, i is incremented to 2
  }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "j"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "i"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "j" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "j"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "i"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "j" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
