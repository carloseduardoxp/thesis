Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Chat {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int x = 5;
        x++; // x becomes 6


    }

}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "x"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "x" local variable., start line = 5, end line = 5, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "x"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "x" local variable., start line = 5, end line = 5.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
