Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        int i, j, k;
        i = 0; // 0
        j = i++; // return i , then increment i
        // j = 0; i = 1;
        k = ++i; // first increment and return i
        //k = 2; i = 2;
        
        // now
        // but , using post increment would 
        // j++ == k-- == i-- // false because => 0 == 2 == 2;
        // but after that statement j will be 1, k = 1, i = 1;
    }
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "k"., start line = 8, end line = 8, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "j"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1659 message = Declare "j" and all following declarations on a separate line., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "j" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "k" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 13, end line = 13, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "k"., start line = 8, end line = 8, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "j"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1659 message = Declare "j" and all following declarations on a separate line., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "j" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "k" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 13, end line = 13, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "k"., start line = 8, end line = 8, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "j"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1659 message = Declare "j" and all following declarations on a separate line., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "j" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "k" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 13, end line = 13, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "k"., start line = 8, end line = 8, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "j"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1659 message = Declare "j" and all following declarations on a separate line., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "j" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "k" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 13, end line = 13.
