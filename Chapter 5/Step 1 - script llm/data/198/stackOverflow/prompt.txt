Given the following Java code snippet:
import java.io.*;

public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        File temp = File.createTempFile("temp",".txt");
    }
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "temp"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "temp" local variable., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "temp"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "temp" local variable., start line = 6, end line = 6.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
