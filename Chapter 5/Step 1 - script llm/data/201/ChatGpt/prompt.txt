Given the following Java code snippet:
public class MyClass {
  // This is a global variable
  public static int myGlobalVariable = 10;
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Use the global variable
      System.out.println(myGlobalVariable);
  }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1444 message = Make this "public static myGlobalVariable" field final, start line = 3, end line = 3.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
