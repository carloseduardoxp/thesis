Given the following Java code snippet:
class Globals {
    public static int globalCounter = 0;
}
public class TestGlobal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Accessing and modifying the global variable
        System.out.println("Counter: " + Globals.globalCounter);
        Globals.globalCounter++;
        System.out.println("Counter after increment: " + Globals.globalCounter);
    }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1444 message = Make this "public static globalCounter" field final, start line = 2, end line = 2.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
