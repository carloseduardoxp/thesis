Given the following Java code snippet:
import java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler;

class MyExceptionHandler implements UncaughtExceptionHandler{
    @Override
    public void uncaughtException(Thread arg0, Throwable arg1) {
        System.out.println("[DEFAULT EXCEPTION HANDLER] Caught some exception");
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread{
    public MyThread() {
        setUncaughtExceptionHandler(new UncaughtExceptionHandler() {
            @Override
            public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) {
                System.out.println("[THREAD SPECIFIC] My exception handler");
            }
        });
    }
    public void run(){
        throw new RuntimeException();
    }
}

public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new MyExceptionHandler());
        new MyThread().start();
        // current thread does not have a thread specific exception handler
        throw new RuntimeException();
    }

}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1604 message = Make this anonymous inner class a lambda (sonar.java.source not set. Assuming 8 or greater.), start line = 12, end line = 12, rule key = java:S112 message = Define and throw a dedicated exception instead of using a generic one., start line = 20, end line = 20, rule key = java:S112 message = Define and throw a dedicated exception instead of using a generic one., start line = 30, end line = 30, rule key = java:S1161 message = Add the "@Override" annotation above this method signature, start line = 19, end line = 19, rule key = java:S1604 message = Make this anonymous inner class a lambda (sonar.java.source not set.

Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
