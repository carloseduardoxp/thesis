Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        String s = "ab7";
        s = s.replaceAll("[0-9]*$", "");
    }
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "s"., start line = 5, end line = 5, rule key = java:S6353 message = Use concise character class syntax '\\d' instead of '[0-9]'., start line = 5, end line = 5, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "s"., start line = 5, end line = 5, rule key = java:S6353 message = Use concise character class syntax '\\d' instead of '[0-9]'., start line = 5, end line = 5.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
