Given the following Java code snippet:

import javax.faces.context.FacesContext;
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import java.util.Map;

@Named
@RequestScoped
public class DialogBean {

    private String param1;
    private String param2;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        Map<String, String> params = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap();
        param1 = params.get("param1");
        param2 = params.get("param2");
    }

    // getters and setters
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1450 message = Remove the "param1" field and declare it as a local variable in the relevant methods., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1450 message = Remove the "param2" field and declare it as a local variable in the relevant methods., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1068 message = Remove this unused "param1" private field., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1068 message = Remove this unused "param2" private field., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1450 message = Remove the "param1" field and declare it as a local variable in the relevant methods., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1450 message = Remove the "param2" field and declare it as a local variable in the relevant methods., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1068 message = Remove this unused "param1" private field., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1068 message = Remove this unused "param2" private field., start line = 11, end line = 11.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
