Given the following Java code snippet:

public class VehicleFactory {

    public enum VehicleType {
        CAR, TRUCK, MOTORCYCLE
    }

    public static Vehicle createVehicle(VehicleType type) {
        return switch (type) {
            case CAR ->
                new Car();
            case TRUCK ->
                new Truck();
            case MOTORCYCLE ->
                new Motorcycle();
            default ->
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown vehicle type");
        };
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
// Usage:
        Vehicle car = VehicleFactory.createVehicle(VehicleFactory.VehicleType.CAR);

    }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "car"., start line = 23, end line = 23, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "car" local variable., start line = 23, end line = 23, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "car"., start line = 23, end line = 23, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "car" local variable., start line = 23, end line = 23.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
