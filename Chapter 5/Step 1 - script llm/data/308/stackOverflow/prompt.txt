Given the following Java code snippet:

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        String[] arr = {"One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"};

        String[] arr2 = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, 2, arr.length); 
        //Note third param is exclusive
    }
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "arr2"., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "arr2" local variable., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "arr2"., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "arr2" local variable., start line = 9, end line = 9.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
