Given the following Java code snippet:
class MyJob extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Job running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyJob job1 = new MyJob();
        MyJob job2 = new MyJob();

        job1.start();
        job2.start();
    }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1161 message = Add the "@Override" annotation above this method signature, start line = 2, end line = 2.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
