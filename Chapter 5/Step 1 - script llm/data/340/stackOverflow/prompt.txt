Given the following Java code snippet:
public class RandomTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int xSpeed = 0;
        int ySpeed = 0;

        if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
            xSpeed = -10;
        } else {
            xSpeed = 10;
        }

        if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
            ySpeed = -10;
        } else {
            ySpeed = 10;
        }
    }
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "xSpeed"., start line = 8, end line = 8, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "xSpeed"., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "ySpeed"., start line = 14, end line = 14, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "ySpeed"., start line = 16, end line = 16, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "xSpeed" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "ySpeed" local variable., start line = 5, end line = 5, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "xSpeed"., start line = 8, end line = 8, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "xSpeed"., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "ySpeed"., start line = 14, end line = 14, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "ySpeed"., start line = 16, end line = 16, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "xSpeed" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "ySpeed" local variable., start line = 5, end line = 5.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
