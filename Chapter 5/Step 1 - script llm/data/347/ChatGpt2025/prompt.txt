Given the following Java code snippet:
import java.sql.*;

public class Chat {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
        PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
        stmt.setString(1, username);
        stmt.setString(2, password);
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();

    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "rs"., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "rs" local variable., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "rs"., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "rs" local variable., start line = 11, end line = 11.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
