Given the following Java code snippet:

import java.sql.*;

public class DeepSeek {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
        try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
            stmt.setString(1, username);
            stmt.setString(2, password);
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            // process results
        }

    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "rs" local variable., start line = 12, end line = 12.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
