Given the following Java code snippet:

import java.awt.*;
import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MouseEvents extends Applet implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener {

    String msg = "";                        // I am not implementing those methods which
    int mouseX = 0, mouseY = 0;             // are not related to my question

    public void init() {
        addMouseListener(this);
        addMouseMotionListener(this);
    }

    public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent me) {
        mouseX = 0;
        mouseY = 10;
        msg = "Mouse Entered";
        repaint();
    }

    public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent me) {
        int currentMouseX = me.getX();
        int currentMouseY = me.getY();
        showStatus("Moving mouse at " + currentMouseX + ", " + currentMouseY);
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.drawString(msg, mouseX, mouseY);
    }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1659 message = Declare "mouseY" on a separate line., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1161 message = Add the "@Override" annotation above this method signature, start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1161 message = Add the "@Override" annotation above this method signature, start line = 29, end line = 29, rule key = java:S1659 message = Declare "mouseY" on a separate line., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1161 message = Add the "@Override" annotation above this method signature, start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1161 message = Add the "@Override" annotation above this method signature, start line = 29, end line = 29.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
