    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];  // 3 rows and 4 columns

    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "matrix"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "matrix" local variable., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "matrix"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "matrix" local variable., start line = 6, end line = 6.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
