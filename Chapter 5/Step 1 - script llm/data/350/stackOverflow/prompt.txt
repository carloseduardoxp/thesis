Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        String[][] value = new String[4][3];
    }
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "value"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "value" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "value"., start line = 4, end line = 4, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "value" local variable., start line = 4, end line = 4.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
