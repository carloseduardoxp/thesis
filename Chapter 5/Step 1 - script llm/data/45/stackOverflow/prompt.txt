Given the following Java code snippet:

import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Teste {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
        //or use this to create our stream 
        //Stream<Integer> stream = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10).boxed();
        int[] array = stream.mapToInt(x -> x).toArray();
    }

}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "array"., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "array" local variable., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "array"., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "array" local variable., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "array"., start line = 10, end line = 10, rule key = java:S125 message = This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed., start line = 9, end line = 9, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "array" local variable., start line = 10, end line = 10.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
