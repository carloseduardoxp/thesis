public class Chat {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int MAX_USERS = 100;        
    }
}



the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "MAX_USERS"., start line = 3, end line = 3, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "MAX_USERS" local variable., start line = 3, end line = 3, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "MAX_USERS"., start line = 3, end line = 3, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "MAX_USERS" local variable., start line = 3, end line = 3.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
