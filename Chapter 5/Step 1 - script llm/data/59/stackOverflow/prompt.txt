Given the following Java code snippet:

import java.util.Iterator;

public class Teste {

    
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Iterator<Object> it = arrayList.iterator();
        while(it.hasNext())
        {
            Object obj = it.next();
            //Do something with obj
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < arrayList.size(); i++) {

        }
    }
    
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "obj"., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "obj" local variable., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S108 message = Remove this block of code, start line = 15, end line = 15, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "obj"., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "obj" local variable., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S108 message = Remove this block of code, start line = 15, end line = 15, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "obj"., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "obj" local variable., start line = 11, end line = 11, rule key = java:S108 message = Remove this block of code, start line = 15, end line = 15.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
