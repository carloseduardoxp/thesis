Given the following Java code snippet:

public class DeepSeek {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String str = "apple,banana,orange";
        String[] fruits = str.split(","); // Split by comma

// Result: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
    }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "fruits"., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "fruits" local variable., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "fruits"., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "fruits" local variable., start line = 7, end line = 7.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
