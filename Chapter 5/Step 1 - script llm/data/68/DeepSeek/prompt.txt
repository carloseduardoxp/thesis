Given the following Java code snippet:
public class DeepSeek {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Hello";
        String str2 = "World";
        String combined = str1 + " " + str2; // "Hello World"
    }
}



the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "combined"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "combined" local variable., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "combined"., start line = 6, end line = 6, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "combined" local variable., start line = 6, end line = 6.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
