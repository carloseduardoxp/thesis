Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Teste {

    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = num.length;
        String s = a + "";
        int lng = s.length();
    }
    
}

the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "lng"., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "lng" local variable., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1854 message = Remove this useless assignment to local variable "lng"., start line = 7, end line = 7, rule key = java:S1481 message = Remove this unused "lng" local variable., start line = 7, end line = 7.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
