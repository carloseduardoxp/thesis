the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S2234 message = Parameters to solveHanoi have the same names but not the same order as the method arguments., start line = 18, end line = 18, rule key = java:S2234 message = Parameters to solveHanoi have the same names but not the same order as the method arguments., start line = 24, end line = 24.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
