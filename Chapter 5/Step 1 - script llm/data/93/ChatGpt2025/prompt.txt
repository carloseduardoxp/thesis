Given the following Java code snippet:
public class Fibonacci {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Number of terms to display
        int a = 0, b = 1;

        System.out.print("Fibonacci sequence: ");

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.print(a + " ");

            int next = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = next;
        }
    }
}


the following improvements are recommended: rule key = java:S1659 message = Declare "b" on a separate line., start line = 4, end line = 4.
Please provide a revised version of the code snippet that applies the recommended improvements. Only the revised code snippet, without additional text.
